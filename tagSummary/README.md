this appears to need meta.txt, so I'm copying this file
https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/cirm/quakeLab/quakeBrainGeo1/meta.txt
this yields a much simpler version than what tagstorm summary does:

There are 3411 total instances of * in quakeBrainGeo1_meta.txt
  Of these, 2414 instances are unique, and if you ignore the leading white space 2413 are unique.

you can search for a specific tag with:
./ontogeny_tagSummary.sh quakeBrainGeo1_meta.txt age
