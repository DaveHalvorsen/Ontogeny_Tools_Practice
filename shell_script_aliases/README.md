breaking up each shell script into individual files breaks the aliases from the old ontogeny_toolkit.sh file
how do I fix that?
well ... each of those scripts had "bin/ontogeny" in common, so I can search by that, which yields 23 results ... seems like a reaonable # to change

???I see a lot of "~clay" ... I think that goes to his home directory ... will that stuff work on my system???

a search for alias yields 93 results. this seems plausible because there's only 17 shell scripts, BUT there could be all sorts of extra aliases that Clay uses ... I'll ahve to figure these out over time

this could be a good time for me to learn about git branching to have the differenet tookit versions ... I could have the .bashrc profile forward tos omething inside the git folder that I can play with ... there are lots of options to fiddle with this here. I think the goal for tonight should be to have the aliases working the same way as the full length ./ versions
