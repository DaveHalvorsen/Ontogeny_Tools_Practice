this works, BUT the file is thousands of lines long ... how do I run tail on it?
./ontogeny_columns.sh hu0A6570.txt 

this should work, but it doesn't colorize it ... why not?
./ontogeny_columns.sh | tail hu0A6570.txt 


./ontogeny_columns.sh hu0A6570.txt 

this is all one color ... making it csv w/ similar command yields same
/ontogeny_columns.sh americangut.csv
