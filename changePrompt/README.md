I can't get on off or reset commands to work ... is this an os thing?
What os does he use? I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 on a T420
I just tried this on my Ubuntu 16.04 desktop Ryzen3 and it didn't work ... perhaps I need to have his .bashrc profile for it to work?

Nope. I just tried that and it still doesn't work.
