./ontogeny_newLs.sh
that run in current directory lists the sh file and the readme
./newLs/ontogeny_newLs.sh
that run in a directory above just lists what's in the above diredctory
./newLs/ontogeny_newLs.sh
this seems to be the same as the list folder ... what is this?
I'll re-visit later

you can run it from another directory like this
./newLs/ontogeny_newLs.sh 

this differens from newLs cause it won't give the number of lines for a file
