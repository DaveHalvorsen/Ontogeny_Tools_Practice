findIt from cjvillar
it collects files of the same extension and outputs that as a file
the N, select another extension doesn't seem to work
can it do files if someone named weirdly? .txt.xls ?

findIt is from cjvillar
you can enter a file extension into it
you save the results as a file
it probably only works in t he current directory

error messages should be better clarifying

Cool! it can work in subdirectories!!!!
