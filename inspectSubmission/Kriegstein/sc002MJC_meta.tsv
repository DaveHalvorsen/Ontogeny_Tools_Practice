Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained from epileptic patients during temporal lobectomy for medically refractory seizures. We were able to classify individual cells into all of the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types in the brain.	PRJNA281204	SRP057196	long-RNA-seq	exon	Homo sapiens
