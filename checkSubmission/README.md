Tagstorms seem to be a UCSC-specific way of tagging files ... I couldn't find an example of such a file.  BUT, I did find kent's repo about playing with them: https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/tree/master/src/tagStorm

Also, here's a GoogleGroup convo about them: https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!msg/genome-mirror/om6IvN4uhIc/5Fol7FNxr6MJ

I'm gonna have to figure this out later. I don't think I can do anything cool with this shell script without a tagstorm file :S

I found one! Clay's shell script says "meta.txt" is a potential name of one of these TagStorms and googling for 'ucsc "meta.txt"' found this file from kent:
https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/cirm/quakeLab/quakeBrainGeo1/meta.txt

Clay's script runs on this file with a success :)
