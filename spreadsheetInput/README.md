i'm not really sure what this is
tag reconciliation utility? 
it looks like it can accept a 'meta.txt' file
this file works :)
https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/cirm/quakeLab/quakeBrainGeo1/meta.txt
i get three text files as output
reconcile_ and then collapsed sorted or unique .txt
i can review this stuff more later

I believe it's for creating supplementary data for submitting an experiment. it asks for my username to hgwdev.sdsc.edu ... lol, I don't have one.
It does auto-create path to the file ... pretty neat

Also it creates an scp command to upload everything. totes cool

I don't know if I'll include this in my collection of files, since I can't actually connect to that database ... I could add it to future directions.
