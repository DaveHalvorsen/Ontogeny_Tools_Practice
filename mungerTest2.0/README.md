mungerTest takes a txt file as an input (it works w/ csv files too!). You set the delimiter and field and it cuts on that yielding just the field (column) of interest cut on the delimiter of interest. Neat! It outputs the results as a file that you can name.

this seems to review text in a .txt file
I think it's for checking out a list that is about to be submitted to a database
I'll revisit
... should add some play files and see what happens :)
his README says: "Use to create a file manifest for CIRM"

for the unescaped.csv example you can use , as a delimiter and it cuts at those positions
then you can select a field (column). then it lets you name a file as output of the information that was selected!
