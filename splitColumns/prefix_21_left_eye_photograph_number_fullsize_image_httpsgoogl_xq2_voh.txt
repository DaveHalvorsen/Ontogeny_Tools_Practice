 my father was left handed and I have some measure of comfort doing things with my opposite hand. In addition what is believed to be a congenital brain injury (AVM) in the left parietal lobe may have resulted in the migration of certain functions to the opposite lobe (hypothesis by neuropsychologist at Brown University after work up in the early '90s)"

my daughter didn't open her eyes at all for the first six weeks or so after she was born and then she slept with her eyes completely open every night until she was about 15 months old.
