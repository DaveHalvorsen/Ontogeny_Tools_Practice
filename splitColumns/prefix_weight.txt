Mother's eyes: Solid medium dark brown (most like #20 but with fewer variations)

 I had dark blond (golden hair) that steadily darkened until it was dark brown but my mid-teens.

My father was similar though he progressed to nearly black hair.

my daughter was diagnosed with ""retinal migraines"" in addition to her eye roll. she was also born pretty strongly farsighted. my dad wears a super strong prescription as well but I don't know his specifics.



my daughter didn't open her eyes at all for the first six weeks or so after she was born and then she slept with her eyes completely open every night until she was about 15 months old.

 but i think the streaks were always the same color. they were visible enough on my scalp when i was an infant that hospital staff thought it was vernix and tried to scrub them off. when i shaved my head in my teens i could still see the stripes on my head

"my dad's hair went from black to completely white in his early thirties. he looked like steve martin. i have more silver hairs than other thirtysomethings I know but nothing like my dad.
