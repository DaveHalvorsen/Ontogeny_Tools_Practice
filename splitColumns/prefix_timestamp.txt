My father had and sister has gray-green eyes (5). They seemed to change based on what they were wearing.

Both brothers have brown eyes like my mother's (21).

Mother's eyes: Solid medium dark brown (most like #20 but with fewer variations)

 everyone will say I have brown to dark brown eyes and are surprised when they get a close look to see much of my outer iris is green."

My father was similar though he progressed to nearly black hair.

 so I am quite anxious to know how reliable these haplotypes might be. Potential implications for autoimmune disorders in my family (just started treatment for psoriatic arthritis after 5+ years of odd signs & symptoms - diagnosis based on lab work and X-rays). This and cytochrome P450 imputations are perhaps the most important info that a participant can derive from whole genome results. Can we consider blanket application to all participants??

- I was diagnosed with endometriosis when my daughter was born via c-section in Sept 2005. ObGyn removed what she could and reported no signs or endometriosis when my son was born in April 2008 via c-section. Both of my kids were breech babies.

- I am the only one of 4 siblings not using glasses. My 3 siblings had had some eye surgery and wore glasses by the time they were 5 years old

Have you considered having participants submit a photo of their eyes so you could draw the more subtle distinctions needed?   Closeup selfies could maintain confidentiality while giving you higher quality input.

 but my daughter was born with pale blue eyes like me and they darkened as she aged. she's 16 now and her eyes look exactly like my dad's eyes. it's a kind of grey that almost doesnt seem like a real color when you look right at it. kind of a dull steel-ish color that looks different depending on the surroundings. like seeing silverware at the bottom of a creek.

 and my daughter has permanent double vision and no depth perception because her eyes both roll away from each other.  the doctor said her brain would delete one eye but it never did. 

my daughter was diagnosed with ""retinal migraines"" in addition to her eye roll. she was also born pretty strongly farsighted. my dad wears a super strong prescription as well but I don't know his specifics.

 but I think that's from an injury. 

my daughter didn't open her eyes at all for the first six weeks or so after she was born and then she slept with her eyes completely open every night until she was about 15 months old.
